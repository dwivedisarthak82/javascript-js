var  nam1= "ram";// var is basically hosted so we get undefine it means it allocated the memory inthe system
let  nam2="shyam";// it is not hosted it means it's value not allocated in system but it store in runtime
const nam3="radha"; //similar to let ,it cannot reintialise
 const arr=[1,2,3,4];
 arr[2]=24;
 console.log(arr);// primitive data type it passes it diret hold value
 // but non primitive value it holds only addres not direct value
